Write a \nsingle-command pipeline that finds all lines containing the word \"ERROR\", extracts \nonly the 3rd column (the timestamp), and saves the count of these errors to a file \nnamed report.txt. \n• Option B (The Cleanup Crew): You have a list of names in users.txt that are messy \n(mixed case, extra spaces). Use a combination of tr, cut, and wc to convert all names \nto lowercase and provide a total count of users in the list. \nCategory 2: The VI Power User \nChoose one of the following tasks: \n• Option A (Efficiency Challenge): List the specific VI command sequences required to: \n1. Delete 5 lines of text starting from the cursor. \n2. Undo that deletion. \n3. Search for the word \"Configuration\" and replace it with \"Setup\" globally. \n• Option B (The Editor's Logic): Explain the functional difference between Command \nMode, Insert Mode, and Last Line Mode. Why does Linux use a modal editor like VI \ninstead of a standard \"point-and-click\" interface for system administration? \nCategory 3: Security & User Management \nChoose one of the following tasks: \n• Option A (The Permissions Audit): You encounter a file with the permissions -rwxr\nxr--. \n1. Translate this into octal (numeric) notation. \n2. Identify what the \"Others\" group can and cannot do. \n3. Provide the command to change this so the \"Owner\" and \"Group\" have full \naccess, but \"Others\" have no access at all. \n• Option B (The Admin's Script): Outline the steps (and commands) to create a new \nuser named dev_user, assign them to a group called developers, and ensure they \nown the directory /home/project_alpha. \nCategory 4: System Navigation & Redirection \nChoose one of the following tasks: \n• Option A (The Search Party): Use the find command to locate all files ending in .sh \nwithin the /etc directory that are larger than 10k. How would you redirect any \n\"Permission Denied\" errors to /dev/null so they don't clutter your screen? \n• Option B (The Tee Connection): Explain a scenario where using the tee command is \nsuperior to using a simple > redirection. Provide a code example demonstrating its \nuse in a real-world system update or log monitoring task. \nSubmission Rules: \n1. Sumit the assessment in PDF format. \n2. For each category choose one option. \n3. PDF should contain the screenshot/snapshots of the commands executed for \neach category followed by the answer to the question asked in each opti"
